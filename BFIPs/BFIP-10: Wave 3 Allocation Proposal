## Simple Summary
I feel there is no need to add back in a community that was included in Round 1. Goal here is to expose different communities from different coins to BOOST and hopefully get them to stay and believe in the vision. Also if we include coins with no other competing yield farming options then we are NOT competing directly with Huge APY and people not participating due to lower APY than other options. Thus 3000 BOOST each is sufficient for these pools. Here are the 5 Coins I propose. Requirement is no clear cut competing yield farming option and somewhat new...

We already included the BIG DEFI coins in Round 1. Most of them are purely seeking yield and don't stick around.

I propose all the above 5 pools to be 90/10 Balancer pools with BOOST as the 10. Reason being to provide buying support for BOOST if they want to be rewarded by farming for BOOST tokens.

Also I propose we switch main pool to SushiSwap. This way we can maybe work with that community to get some announcement as one of the first pools using SLP instead of UNI-LP pool tokens. 

## Abstract
Single Asset pools are dillutive and provide little value. Requiring 10% of BOOST in a 90/10 pool it requires them to acquire BOOST before participating and then when they exit it could provide them incentive to hold it as well.

## Motivation
Tired of seeing the rich get richer with all the big cap defi tokens being included in every farming opportunity thus leaving the smaller token communities out.
